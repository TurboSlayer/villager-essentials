 Edits to villagers and zombies to make villager trading simpler in multiplayer Minecraft (Spigot tested, Paper unknown)
 
 This plugin adds 3 features:
 1. Villagers will always transform into a zombie villager when killed by any zombie variant (i.e. a zombie, zombie villager, husk, or drowned). This is true regardless of difficulty. This prevents villagers from being forever lost when killed by a zombie. Inspired by MarioFinale's VillagerSaver plugin (https://github.com/MarioFinale/VillagerSaver).
 2. All players receive trading discounts when one player cures a villager. Inspired by RevengeOfLordMagic's Global Trades datapack (https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/global-trades/).
 3. All zombie variants have a 50% chance of being able to pick up items. This is true regardless of difficulty. Zombies that pick up items do not despawn, thus eliminating the need to rare nametags. This is useful for holding a zombie in a villager trading hall to transform villagers for curing. Gecko uses this in their trading hall tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Btd27JpomJk).
